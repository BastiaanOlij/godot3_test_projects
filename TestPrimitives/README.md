# Test primitives

This is a test project for testing the new primitives module which introduces a number of generated objects which can be used to quickly prototype some scenes.

I need to add some better textures for a few things, for instance the top and bottom texture for the cones split the bottom part of the texture in two, not in threes. 

You'll need to compile Godot 3 including the following PR if it has not yet been merged into master:
